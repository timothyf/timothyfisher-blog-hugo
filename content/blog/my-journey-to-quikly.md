Within the last month I left a large established Detroit-based services company to join a small technology startup in downtown Detroit.  The company I joined was [Quikly](http://www.quikly.com/).  Quikly is a platform that helps marketers drive immediate and measurable results by digitally engaging consumers in a friendly competition to earn rewards.  The platform incorporates a lot of pretty cool technologies which I plan on talking about over time.  Some of Quikly’s customers include: [Victoria’s Secret](http://www.victoriassecret.com), [Dominos](http://www.dominos.com), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), [Toys R Us](http://www.toysrus.com), [Quicken Loans](http://www.quickenloans.com), [Pet Supplies Plus](http://www.petsuppliesplus.com) and [Kraft](http://www.kraft.com).

I joined Quikly as their VP of Technology with the excitement of being able to help shape the technology and the engineering culture here as we continue to grow the company.

I think each of us know when it’s time to make a change in our career.  I’d reach that point with my previous employer.  The company had been going through a period of change and I was at a place where I felt much of the passion that fuels me had been missing for sometime.  Those who know me, also know that I’m someone who is very passionate about what I do.  The software development business is not just a job for me, it’s a passion and something that I love doing.  It’s a significant part of my life.  I’m a guy who is always learning new technologies, new platforms, and keeping up on software development trends in general.  I’m also someone who is passionate about company culture and being able to help shape that culture.  So much of our life is spent in the workplace, I believe that the workplace should be a fun place that we don’t despise going to, but a place where we really enjoy working in.  The workplace should provide motivation, and encourage enthusiasm and a culture of continuous learning.  A company should be transparent, open, and listen to the voices of its employees. I believe Quikly is on the right path to building this type of culture as we grow and something I am eager to be a part of and to help shape.

The Quikly technology platform is built on the Ruby on Rails platform.  Again, those who know me will also know this is a platform that I am intimately familiar with and a platform that I love working with.  Back in 2008 I even wrote a book about Ruby on Rails, The [Ruby on Rails Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Bible-Timothy-Fisher/dp/0470258225).  So from a technology standpoint, Quikly is an ideal fit for me.

Finally, Quikly is reaching a point in their growth cycle where they will be facing some very interesting and dare I say exciting challenges in growing and scaling their technology platform.  In my role, I will be able to help Quikly take on those challenges and built a platform that is robust and scalable to the masses.

These are some of the reasons why I made this transition and why I am excited to be a part of what we are building at Quikly.  

Finally, I also am a strong believer in participating the local tech community.  When we share with others, we are all better off for having done that.   I love going to local conferences and meet-ups because I feel there is always something new to learn.   I also find it incredibly enriching to be immersed in the community.  I plan on continuing to talk about some of the cool things we are doing from a technology and culture standpoint at Quikly, both here online and hopefully at some future conferences.   I hope you’ll continue to follow and read about this journey.  If you are on Twitter, give me a follow there as well to keep up with what I’m doing.  I typically share a lot of technical content through Twitter as well.   Twitter: [@tfisher](http://twitter.com/tfisher)
