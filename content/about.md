I am the VP of Technology for [Quikly](http://www.quikly.com), a Detroit-based startup.   

I am a passionate technologist and leader with 25 years of software development experience in roles including Chief Architect, Developer, Technical Director, and VP of Technology. My experience spans the areas of mobile development, web development, Ruby/Rails, Java/J2EE, JavaScript, application performance, and scalable architecture. 

In addition to hands-on technology work, I am also passionate about educating, mentoring, and building communities of practice. I have been an evangelist for great software development in the Detroit area for many years. I also enjoys technical writing and have authored the [Java Phrasebook](http://www.amazon.com/Java-Phrasebook-Timothy-R-Fisher/dp/0672329077) and the [Ruby on Rails Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Bible-Timothy-Fisher/dp/0470258225).
